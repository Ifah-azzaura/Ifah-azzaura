 Hello, world ! 
 @Ifah-azzaura is here.
  
 I've finally learned what annoyed me the most. 
 Fyi, 
 I once repeated computational physics and quantum physics class 
 when I was undergraduate student.
 
 But now, 
 oh my God ! 
 I actually don't know why I'm drowning in those two fields.
 
 well, I am a master's student in theoretical physics. 
 I even got into coding and enjoy it so much.
 
 Letâ€™s talk about programming and code something awesome with me !
